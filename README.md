# LemonGeorge
 
LemonGeorge is not meant to be distributed and instead is for my own personal use, therefore I did not write down instructions nor design it with the plan for others to add to their own servers.

This does not mean I am against the use of this code elsewhere, just that it was not something I kept in mind when coding.

This is a discord bot that can respond to multiple prompts with unique dialog. It can also play music in voice chat via youtube links.

I did not include the .env files which would have the bot tokens, the server name, and the IPv4 address of your computer. Also not included is the download of ffmpeg.exe

If using LemonGeorge, type `help into the chat to find out what he can do.
